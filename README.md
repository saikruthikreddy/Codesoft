In this project, I worked on three distinct machine learning tasks. First, I built a predictive model using the Titanic dataset to determine whether a passenger survived or not. This classic beginner project involved analyzing various features like age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status. Next, I developed a Movie Rating Prediction model that estimates movie ratings based on features such as genre, director, and actors. By applying regression techniques, the project provided insights into how these factors influence movie ratings. Lastly, I tackled Credit Card Fraud Detection by building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent transactions. I preprocessed and normalized transaction data, handled class imbalance issues, and used classification algorithms like logistic regression and random forests. The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score, and I explored techniques like oversampling and undersampling to improve results.
